# LITA-Capstone-Project-2
The project analyzed customer data from a subscription service to understand subscription patterns, customer segments, and retention trends. Excel was used for pivot table analysis, followed by SQL queries to identify popular subscription types, cancellation trends, and revenue by segment.

### Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

### Project Overview
This project aimed to analyze customer data from a subscription service to understand subscription patterns, customer segments, and retention trends. Excel was initially used for pivot table analysis to examine subscription types, average durations, and regional distributions. SQL queries further identified customer behaviour insights, such as popular subscription types, cancellation trends, and revenue by segment. The final Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive view of customer segments, highlighting opportunities to improve retention and optimize subscription offerings.

###Data Sources
Customer data for this project was also sourced from the "LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx" file, which includes customer profiles, subscription types, revenue, and cancellation details. Similar to Project 1, this data was converted to a CSV format for import into SQL Server to facilitate SQL-based analysis.
